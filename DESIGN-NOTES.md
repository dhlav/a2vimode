# Design Notes for a2vimode

This document covers the basic "How It Works" of a2vimode, and also a number of pitfalls encountered, on different hardware and DOS platforms, and the workarounds to them.

## Basic Theory

### Checking For GetLn

When a2vimode is started, a routine is installed to the Standard Input hook, `KSW` (or more accurately, the DOS or ProDOS "inner" equivalent to `KSW`). When this routine is called, it looks at call-return values on the stack (the addresses to which the `PC` register is set, on successive 6502 `RTS` operations), to determine if it's being called from the firmware's line-prompt facility, known as `GetLn` or `GETLN`. Specifically, it looks for (most-recent caller):

 - An optional return to a DOS or ProDOS `KSW` wrapper routine (this return can be any word less than `$C000`)
 - A return to the `RdChar` routine (which is called by `GetLn` to check for and handle `Esc` keyrpesses, for transposing the cursor to somewhere else on the screen; the expected return value is normally `$FD37`, but on the Apple //c specifically it will instead be a sequence of 2 or 3 words in the `$Cxxx` range, so those are accepted instead.
 - Finally, it must find the expected return to the `GetLn` routine (always `$FD77`)

(Note: if you want to verify for yourself where those return addresses arrive at, please remember that `RTS` will *add one to the value on the stack* before setting the program counter, so although the routine checks for a return address of `$FD77`, the real location of the actual instruction that would be returned to, is `$FD78` (and the `JSR` instruction that (eventually) got to us, is 3 bytes earlier at `$FD75` (2 bytes less than the address on the stack). None of these, of course, are the *starts* of the routines, they are simply the point in the routine where a `JSR` operation called us (or called a routine that called us, etc).)There is no practical way to distinguish this situation from a real call from `GetLn`, but thankfully it is a very unlikely scenario.

These call-stack values are correct for every known model of Apple II running the official firmware ROMs, plus also the ROM 4X on the Apple //c. It is unknown whether these values will work on unofficial Apple II *clones*, and may not work with customized ROMs. In such cases, it would be necessary to modify **a2vimode**'s call-check routine in order for it to work on that platform.

### If We Are In GetLn

If the check succeeds, we know we are currently "in" the firmware prompt. We then *edit* the stack, replacing the call-return for `GetLn` (`$FD77`) with an address that instead "returns" into our special prompt-replacement routineâ€”the routine that handles all the special vi-mode bindings and commands. We then immediately return with the space character (`$A0`) in the accumulator, just to let us wind our way back up the stack, through whatever DOS wrapper, and `RdChar`, until it "returns" into our prompt replacement (which just ignores the returned char, and prompts for a new one).

An early development version of this software didn't immediately return a space, but instead served as a prompt for the first character that would be received by our prompt-replacement routine. We would edit the stack so as to remove `RdChar` from the return-sequence (so that the DOS or ProDOS KSW hook would skip the return to `RdChar`, and return instead directly into our prompt replacement). However, DOS tends to be sensitive to stack size changes, since it does manipulations of its own, and did not respond well to our removing a call frame from the stack. So we leave the stack the same size, and leave `RdChar` in place, and return a dummy space character so there's no possibility of `RdChar` seeing an `Esc` from user input, and handling it specially.)

Note that, since the stack can hold arbitrary values that were pushed onto the stack, and not merely call-returns, it is entirely possible that a program could push just the right (or wrong) values onto the stack, prior to calling our Standard-Input hook routine, and trick it into believing it was called from `GetLn` via `RdChar`, when in fact it was not. This could cause a crash when returning from our replacement prompt routine, but fortunately this scenario is unlikely enough that it shouldn't happen under typical circumstances. If it should happen, the solution would be to avoid using **a2vimode** together with whatever program happens to like pushing those values on the stack just prior to invoking `KSW`. 

### Additional AppleSoft Check

After a successful check for `GetLn`, when we already know we're going to replace `GetLn` with our replacement prompt routine, we do an additional check to see if that `GetLn` was in turn called from AppleSoft's main ("direct mode") user prompt. Specifically, it checks for:

 - A call-return to `InLine` (the AppleSoft routine that calls `GetLn`, and then converts the input buffer to "real" ASCII codes, terminated by a `NUL` (`#$00`) instead of a carriage return (`#$8D`) - stack value `$D532`). This routine is in turn called from:
 - A call-return to `Restart` (`D443`)

If this secondary check succeeds, a flag is set so that the replacement prompt knows that it's being used in AppleSoft's direct mode - this will enable features like auto-increment line numbers, and summoning lines of BASIC to the prompt (which are not permitted in other prompt situations).

### If We Are *Not* In GetLn

If the check fails, then we were not called from `GetLn`, and so we just jump to the firmware's "grab a keypress" routine, to do what a Standard-Input routine is normally expected to do.
